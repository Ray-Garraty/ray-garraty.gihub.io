<p>The United States Air Force (USAF) has acquired a CUAS (counter-unmanned aerial systems) radar system from <a href="https://blacksagetech.com/">Black Sage</a> that will provide precise targeting data for the Air Force Research Laboratory&#8217;s (AFRL) Tactical High Power Microwave Operational Responder (THOR). THOR is a counter-swarm electromagnetic weapon developed to defend airbases from threats such as rogue drones, using High Power Microwaves (HPM) to cause a counter electronic effect and instantly defeat targets.</p>
<p>Black Sage has also provided its proprietary DefenseOS software to receive and process the precise targeting data required by the THOR system from the CUAS radars. The data is exported to the US military&#8217;s Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2). The integrated CUAS radar system, FAAD C2 and THOR weapon has already been successfully trialled, targeting and defeating multiple drones. DefenseOS is an open architecture command and control software that has to date facilitated the rapid integration of over 30 CUAS sensors and effectors</p>
<p>In the continuous pursuit of high-performing CUAS sensors and effectors, Black Sage has evaluated five different Passive RF components and multiple radar sensors in this calendar year alone.</p>
<p>Trent Morrow, Black Sage&#8217;s Chief Strategy Officer, commented: &#8220;We are pleased to announce that the Air Force purchased a CUAS radar system from Black Sage to integrate with AFRL&#8217;s THOR weapon. This is another step forward in Black Sage&#8217;s relationship with the Air Force.&#8221;</p>

The tests, performed at the company&#8217;s Tranquility Base test range, included the communications system, navigational guidance system, autopilot, take-off and landing performance, general flight stability and performance, multiple velocity vectors and altitude profiles, sound pressure levels, and battery consumption characteristics.</p>
<p>The Robin XL is a mid-size electric hybrid VTOL/fixed-wing drone with an expected range of 60km (37mi) and a payload capacity of 11.3kg (25lb). It includes an advanced integrated parachute system that is expected to mitigate its risk profile and potentially allow for flight over people in the future, thus opening up further applications. Cargo is stored safely and securely inside the drone, with temperature control capabilities. The Robin XL can also carry specialized cameras and sensor payloads.</p>
<p>All the flight tests were conducted in accordance with approvals provided by Transport Canada. The drone is intended to be operated in rural and remote locations, and according to proposed regulations will not require a formal aircraft type-certification for these lower-risk applications. DDC plans to begin COVID-19 support activities and remote area deliveries once testing has been fully completed. Flight approvals will be requested through Transport Canada, following the straightforward and well-established Special Flight Operations Certificate (SFOC) process that DDC has successfully used in the past.</p>
<p>The Robin XL is designed to work with DDC&#8217;s proprietary DroneSpot depot system, automated battery management system and FLYTE software system. Future versions are expected to incorporate a touchless cargo drop functionality. The turnkey solution is marketed in a managed service SaaS business model in Canada and as a licensed managed service internationally.</p>
<p>Michael Zahra, President &amp; CEO of DDC, commented: &#8220;We are very pleased with the ongoing successful testing of our Robin XL delivery drone. The Sparrow, Robin XL and Condor all have unique commercial use-case applications based on range and payload capabilities, and we are excited to have the Condor and Robin XL models coming to market soon. Robin XL &amp; Condor pre-selling efforts are underway and market response has been very favourable in Canada and internationally, and we are working on a number of specific prospective opportunities for both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Based on technology that was originally created for missile defense applications, IRIS provides enhanced situational awareness for operators of both UAVs and UGVs (unmanned ground vehicles). The system fuses data from a wide range of real-time sensors, including Unifly&#8217;s BLIP, to provide drone pilots with a precise real-time picture of their operational airspace when piloting one or more UAVs beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p>
<p>BLIP uses real-time drone tracking to enable safe BVLOS flights. The autonomous weather-proof tracker is a stand-alone device that is mounted to the drone but functions independently, with its own power source and sensors for position, altitude, temperature, pressure, speed and direction. BLIP broadcasts the drone’s identification information, 3D location and take-off position over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and features an integrated Data Platform that translates the data and forwards it in real-time to multiple UTM systems or real-time airspace situational awareness applications such as IRIS.</p>
<p>Ranald McGillis, President of Kongsberg Geospatial, commented: &#8220;We’re proud to be part of the important role of flight safety in unmanned vehicle operations. Our IRIS Airspace management for unmanned systems was created to help safely operate drones and autonomous vehicles beyond visual line-of-sight. The Unifly BLIP technology is a world leader to help effectively integrate unmanned systems into a variety of urban operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laurent Huenaerts, General Manager of Unifly in North America, said: &#8220;Remote identification and real-time tracking are two foundational capabilities for the safe and secure integration of drones into the airspace, especially around critical infrastructure and in urban areas. The Unifly BLIP tracker provides this information and its Data Platform allows for a seamless integration with situational awareness systems like IRIS. We are very pleased to now be integrated with the world-leading airspace visualization platform that Kongsberg Geospatial has developed.&#8221;</p>
